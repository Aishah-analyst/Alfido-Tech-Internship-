### Data Sources
Sales dataset obtained from Kaggle.

### Tool Used
- Microsoft Excel (2013+)
- - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- - Slicers for interactivity
- - Dashboard for visual representation and interactive analysis


### Data Cleaning / Preparation
- Removed duplicate entries.
- Corrected data types (dates, currency).
- Handled missing values.
- Created calculated fields for delivery time and YoY growth.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Reviewed sales distribution by region, product category, and customer segment.
- Identified peak sales months.
- Analyzed top customers and top-selling products.

### Data Analysis
- KPI Tracking: Total Orders & Total Sales with YoY comparison.
- Regional Performance: West region leading in revenue.
- Category Insights: Technology category generated the most sales.
- Customer Segments: Consumer segment drove the highest revenue.
- Delivery Impact: Standard delivery time contributed to most sales.

### Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Sales peaked in November across multiple years.
- Phones were the highest-selling product.
- Raymond Buch was the top client in total revenue.
- The West region consistently outperformed other regions.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
- Focus marketing and stock management on top-selling products like Phones.
- Leverage peak months (e.g., November) for targeted promotions.
- Invest in technology product lines for higher ROI.
- Strengthen presence in low-performing regions to balance sales distribution.

### Limitations
- Product ID and Customer ID were intentionally excluded from the dashboard visuals to maintain readability and avoid redundancy, since Product Name, Order ID, and Customer Name already provided sufficient identifiers for analysis.
- This approach improves dashboard clarity and focuses on actionable insights rather than backend data points.
- However, the IDs are still preserved in the raw dataset (not displayed) to ensure accurate future dataset merging, duplicate handling, or deeper product/customer-level tracking if required.
